frida and firefox
  a match made in heaven

frida injects into a firefox process
  probably a render process

create a page with a Dharma-created DOM
apply a dharma-generated CSS string to the DOM
loop the following for ~1000 repititions or so:
  find the function that takes CSS input and parses it
  hook it
  send() message back to Python using Frida api
  python interfaces with radamsa to mess up the CSS
  send() the message back to Frida, in the browser
  browser continues with CSS parse function
window.reload() the page after ~1000 reps for a new DOM

advantages over in-browser fuzzing:
  possibly faster than fuzzing the CSS in-browser ?
  leverage radamsa and dharma grammars without remaking in js
